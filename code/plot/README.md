This folder contains code to plot Figures 2 through 8 from

> MJ Landis, DAR Eaton, WL Clement, B Park, EL Spriggs, PW Sweeney, EJ Edwards, & MJ Donoghue. Joint phylogenetic estimation of geographic movements and biome shifts during the global diversification of Viburnum. Systematic Biology (advance access), https://doi.org/10.1093/sysbio/syaa027.

Scripts for plotting figures:

- Fig 2 - `plot_fig2_topology.R`
- Fig 3 - `plot_fig3_mcc.R`
- Fig 4 - `plot_fig4_bg.R`
- Fig 5 - `plot_fig5_biome.R`
- Fig 6 - `plot_fig6_fossil_sensitivity.R`
- Fig 7 - `plot_fig7_lstt.R`
- Fig 8 - `plot_fig8_tx_graph.R`

In general, plotting scripts will expect to see the 3 biomes and 6 regions defined in the main paper. You may need to modify the scripts accordingly if your analysis uses a different biome and region definitions. Feel free to contact me if you need help with this.

More flexible plotting tools to come in the future.
