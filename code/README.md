To run the analysis, call `rb run_quick.Rev` from within this directory. That script will in turn call all the necessary model scripts. There are many settings you can tweak within `run_quick.Rev`. I've done my best to comment the scripts so that others may modify them freely. Feel welcome to contact me with any quesitons.

The `plot/` directory contains R scripts to generate the plots in the manuscript using the files in `../output/`.
